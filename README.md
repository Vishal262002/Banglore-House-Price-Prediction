# 🏠 Bangalore House Price Prediction

This repository contains a **Machine Learning project** implemented in a Jupyter Notebook to predict **house prices in Bangalore** based on various features such as location, total square feet area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the price of houses in Bangalore using regression techniques.
Key steps included:

* Data loading and cleaning
* Feature engineering (e.g., handling missing values, encoding location, dimensionality reduction)
* Outlier detection and removal
* Model training and evaluation
* Prediction using a trained regression model

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language**: Python 3
* **Libraries**:

  * NumPy, Pandas (data manipulation)
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)
  * Scikit-learn (ML models & evaluation)
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about houses in Bangalore, including:

* Location
* Total square feet area
* Number of bedrooms (BHK)
* Number of bathrooms
* Price (target variable)

*(If dataset is not shared in repo, link the source here: e.g., Kaggle or CSV file)*

## 🔑 Key Insights

* Location is one of the strongest predictors of price.
* Outliers significantly impact regression performance.
* Feature engineering (e.g., price per sqft calculation) improves accuracy.
* Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Trees were tested for prediction.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook BHP.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells to see preprocessing, training, and predictions.
